## ParseC

ParseC is a LLVM/Clang-based tool to parse a C program (hence the name). It extracts functions, structures, etc. along with their inter-dependencies.

ParseC is built as part of the [Docker image](Dockerfile) for this project. However, it can also be built and run independently.

### Prerequisites

ParseC is intended for use only with Linux. The following utilities and libraries are needed:
- `build-essential`
- `cmake`
- `bear`
- `llvm-14`, `llvm-14-dev`, `llvm-14-tools`, `clang-14`, `libclang-14-dev`

### Build

```sh
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. && make
```
If compilation is successful, the `parsec` binary will be created in the `build` directory. You can add it to your `PATH`, or access it by its full file path.

### Usage

`parsec` can be run on a single C file, say `hello.c`, as follows:

```sh
parsec hello.c
```

To run it on a full project, you need a `compile_commands.json` compilation database for your project. This can be obtained in a few different ways:
- If your project uses CMake, you can generate one automatically by setting [`CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS.html).
- If your project uses `make`, you can use the `bear` utility to generate a compilation database:
  ```
  bear -- make
  ```
Once you have `compile_commands.json`, you can run `parsec` like this:

```
parsec *.c
```

### Output

The output of `parsec` is a single JSON file, `analysis.json`, created in the current working directory. The format of this file is described herein:

```

      "signature": str,
      "num_args": int,
      "argTypes": [str],
      "argNames": [str],
      "returnType": [str],
      "filename": str,
      "startLine": int,
      "endLine": int,
      "startCol": int,

      "functions": [

        },
        ...
      ],

        },
        ...
      ],
      "globals": [
        {
          "name": str
        },
        ...
      ]
    },
    ...
  ]
  "structs": [
    {
      "name": str,
      "filename": str,
      "startLine", int,
      "endLine", int,
      "startCol", int,
      "endCol", endCol
    },
    ...
  ],
  "enums": [
    {
      "name": str,
      "filename": str,
      "startLine", int,
      "endLine", int,
      "startCol", int,
      "endCol", endCol
    },
    ...
  ],
  "globals": [
    {
      "name": str,
      "type": str,
      "filename": str,
      "startLine": int,
      "endLine": int,
      "startCol": int,
      "endCol": int,
      "isStatic": bool
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```
Note that the field `files` is intended to be populated with a list of source files and metadata about each one; however, this functionality is not yet implemented and the `files` field will currently always contain an empty list.

### Options and Customization

`parsec` has two command line flags, `--add-instr` and `--rename-main`. These are intended for internal use and debugging only.
