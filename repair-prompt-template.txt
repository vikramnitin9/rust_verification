Error while running verification for function: $function_name
STDOUT: $failure_lines
STDERR: $stderr
Remember to add the contracts (__CPROVER_requires and __CPROVER_ensures) in the function header,
not the function body.
Your response is in the following format:

{ "function_with_specs": "<SOURCE CODE HERE>" }

There is no need to delimit the format with tags, return the plain object and nothing else.
Do not include any explanations or re-define other functions.
