# Requirements

You must have the following dependencies installed on your system to work with
  this repository:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/)
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
- make: a modern version.  (Version 3.81 from 2006, which is installed by default on Macintosh computers, is not adequate.)  [This might not be necessary any more; the ancient version of `make` should still work.]
