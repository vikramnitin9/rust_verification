Your job is to re-generate specifications for $function_to_backtrack_to,
which is a callee of $function_under_recovery.

The reasoning for re-generating specifications for $function_to_backtrack_to is:

$backtracking_reasoning

Here is the implementation of $function_under_recovery with the specifications
that are failing to verify:

$function_under_recovery_implementation

Now, could you re-write a "__CPROVER_requires" and "__CPROVER_ensures" contract for
$function_to_backtrack_to? The current implementation is below:

```c
$function_to_backtrack_to_implementation
```

Remember to add the contracts ("__CPROVER_requires" and "__CPROVER_ensures") in the function header, not the function body.
Give me the entire function with specifications in the format below:

{ "function_with_specs": "<SOURCE CODE HERE>" }

There is no need to delimit the format with tags, return the plain object and nothing else.
Do not redefine any other functions; assume they are already available elsewhere in the program.
Do not include any header files; assume that all necessary headers are already included.
Do not include explanations.
