Repair the specifications for $function_name using the information below:

Remember to add the contracts (__CPROVER_requires and __CPROVER_ensures) in the function header,
not the function body.

Here's the current implementation of $function_name:

$function_implementation

Your response is in the following format:

{
  "precondition_expressions": [...],
  "postcondition_expressions": [...],
  "assigned_variables": []
}

Where each expression can be independently input to a __CPROVER clause.

Here's an example of a legal response:

{
  "precondition_expressions": [
    "__CPROVER_is_fresh(out, sizeof(*out))",
    "a > 0",
    "b > 0"
  ],
  "postcondition_expressions": [
    "(__CPROVER_return_value == SUCCESS) ==> (*out == (a + b))",
    "(__CPROVER_return_value == FAILURE) ==> (*out == __CPROVER_old(*out))",
    "*out > 0"
  ],
  "assigned_variables": ["out"]
}

You'll remember the following guidelines:
* CBMC symbolically expands all of the preconditions, (e.g., the argument of __CPROVER_is_fresh)
  before it applies the constraints from later clauses. Make sure you constrain any values before
  you use them in later pre or postconditions.
* Use INT_MAX and/or INT_MIN to reason about overflows.
* There is no need to delimit the format with tags, return the plain object and nothing else.
* Do not redefine any other functions; assume they are already available elsewhere in the program.
* Do not include any header files; assume that all necessary headers are already included.
* Do not include explanations or comments.

There is no need to delimit the format with tags, return the plain object and nothing else.
Do not include any explanations or re-define other functions.
