Remember to add the contracts (__CPROVER_requires and __CPROVER_ensures) in the function header,
not the function body.

Here's the current implementation of $function_name:

$function_implementation

Your response is in valid JSON with the following schema:

{
    "preconditions": [...],
    "postconditions": [...]
}

You'll remember the following guidelines:
* CBMC symbolically expands all of the preconditions, (e.g., the argument of __CPROVER_is_fresh)
  before it applies the constraints from later clauses. Make sure you constrain any values before
  you use them in later pre or postconditions.
* Use INT_MAX and/or INT_MIN to reason about overflows.
* Do not re-use names for variable bounds across clauses or expressions (i.e., Use unique loop and
  array bounds.)
* There is no need to delimit the format with tags, return the plain object and nothing else.
* Do not redefine any other functions; assume they are already available elsewhere in the program.
* Do not include any header files; assume that all necessary headers are already included.
* Do not include explanations or comments.
