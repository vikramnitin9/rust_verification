Error while running verification for function: $function_name
STDOUT: $failure_lines
STDERR: $stderr
Remember to add the contracts (__CPROVER_requires and __CPROVER_ensures) in the function header,
not the function body.

Here is the current implementation of $function_name with line numbers:

$function_implementation

Your response is in the following format:

{ "function_with_specs": "<SOURCE CODE HERE>" }

There is no need to delimit the format with tags, return the plain object and nothing else.
Do not include any explanations or re-define other functions.

Here are some tips:
* CBMC symbolically expands all of the preconditions, for example the argument of __CPROVER_is_fresh,
  before it applies the constraints from later __CPROVER_requires clauses, so make sure you 
  constrain relevant values first before using them in subsequent clauses.
* Use INT_MAX and/or INT_MIN, if required, to reason about overflows.
