Error while running verification for function: $function_name
STDOUT: $failure_lines
STDERR: $stderr
Remember to add the contracts (__CPROVER_requires and __CPROVER_ensures) in the function header,
not the function body.

Here's the current implementation of $function_name:

$function_implementation

Your response is in the following format:

{ "function_with_specs": "<SOURCE CODE HERE>" }

Try to use the tips below if they might be useful:
* Use INT_MAX and/or INT_MIN to reason about overflows.
* CBMC symbolically expands all of the preconditions, (e.g., the argument of __CPROVER_is_fresh)
  before it applies the constraints from later clauses. Make sure you constrain any values before
  you use them in later pre or postconditions.

There is no need to delimit the format with tags, return the plain object and nothing else.
Do not include any explanations or re-define other functions.
