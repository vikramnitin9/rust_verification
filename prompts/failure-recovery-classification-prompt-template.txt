The following is the specification with the fewest errors reported by CBMC
for the function $function_name:

$function_with_specifications

CBMC reports the following errors:

$failure_lines

$stderr

Classify the next step to take for handling this failure, choose from:

    ASSUME_SPEC: When CBMC is insufficiently expressive to prove the implementation of
        $function_name satisfies the current specification.
    BACKTRACK_TO_CALLEES: When the specification might be consistent with $function_name, but not
        necessarily with a callee's contract.

Your response should comprise your reasoning process and the next step you take for handling
the failure. Specifically, state the reasoning first and follow up with the next step, i.e.,

{
    "reasoning": ...,
    "next_step": ...
}
