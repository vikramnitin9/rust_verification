The following is the specification with the fewest errors reported by CBMC
for the function $function_name:

$function_with_specifications

CBMC reports the following errors:

$failure_lines

$stderr

$callees_for_function_with_specifications

Classify the next step to take for handling this failure, choose from:

    ASSUME_SPEC: When CBMC is insufficiently expressive to prove the implementation of
        $function_name satisfies the current specification.
    BACKTRACK_TO_CALLEE: When the specification might be consistent with $function_name, but not
        necessarily with a callee's contract. Choose the callee to backtrack to, taking their
        specifications into account.


Your response should comprise your reasoning process and the next step you take for handling
the failure. Specifically, state the reasoning first and follow up with the classification, i.e.,

{
    "reasoning": "<YOUR_REASONING>",
    "classification": {
        "action": ...,
        "callee_for_backtracking": ...
    }
}

For example, if you choose that assuming the specification is the best course of action, your
response should be:

{
    "reasoning": "<YOUR REASONING>",
    "classification": {
        "action": "ASSUME_SPEC",
        "callee_for_backtracking": null
    }
}

Here is an example response for backtracking:

{
    "reasoning": "<YOUR REASONING>",
    "classification": {
        "action": "BACKTRACK_TO_CALLEE",
        "callee_for_backtracking": <THE CALLEE TO BACKTRACK TO>
    }
}
