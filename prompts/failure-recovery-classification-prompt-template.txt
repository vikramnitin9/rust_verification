The following is the specification with the fewest errors reported by CBMC
for the function $function_name:

$function_with_specifications

CBMC reports the following errors:

$failure_lines

$stderr

Classify the next step to take for handling this failure, choose from:

    GIVE_UP: When CBMC is insufficiently expressive to prove the implementation of $function_name
             satisfies the current specification.
    BACKTRACK: When the specification might be consistent with $function_name, but necessarily with
             a callee's contract.
    KEEP_GOING: When there is not enough information to make a decision whether to give up or
             backtrack.

Your response should comprise the next step, and your brief reasoning for selecting it, e.g.,

{
    "next_step": ...,
