Here is the current specification for $function_name:

$source_code

$callee_context

The following failures are reported by CBMC:

$failure_information

Given this information, select from the three options:

    1. Assume the specification as-is, and proceed with verifying the rest of the program.
    2. Return a repaired specification that verifies successfully.
    3. Choose a callee of $function_name that might require a stronger postcondition, and state in what way the postcondition must be strengthened.


If you choose (1), your response should be in the following format:

{
    "next_step": "ASSUME_SPEC_AS_IS",
}

If you choose (2), your response should be in the following format:

{
    "next_step": "REPAIR_SPEC",
    "function_with_specs": "<FUNCTION_WITH_REPAIRED_SPEC>"
}

If you choose (3), your response should be in the following format:

{
    "next_step": "REGENERATE_CALLEE_SPEC",
    "reasoning_for_stronger_postcondition": "<REASONING>",
    "callee": "<CALLEE_NAME>",
    "function_with_specs": "<CALLEE_WITH_REGENERATED_SPECS>",
}
