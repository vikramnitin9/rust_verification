Here is the current specification for $function_name:

$source_code

$callee_context

The following failures are reported by CBMC:

$failure_information

Given this information, select from the two options:

    1. Assume the specification as-is, and proceed with verifying the rest of the program.
    2. Choose a callee of $function_name, and state in what way the postcondition must be
       strengthened in order for $function_name's specifications to verify.

<KEY POINTS>

You should almost always select (1) unless you have strong evidence that (2) will result in a
specification that verifies for $function_name

</KEY POINTS>

If you choose (1), your response should be in the following format:

{
    "next_step": "ASSUME_SPEC_AS_IS",
}

If you choose (2), your response should be in the following format:

{
    "next_step": "BACKTRACK_TO_CALLEE",
    "postcondition_change_for_callee": "<DESCRIPTION>",
    "callee": "<CALLEE_NAME>",
    # TODO(maybe): Ask it to generate the strengthened spec for the callee, then run the verifier on
    # the failing function, assuming the strengthened spec, then backtrack based on that result.
